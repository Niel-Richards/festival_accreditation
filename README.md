**README**

**Intro**
Festival Accreditation is a web app designed to be used on a local network at a festival sites where internet connectivity is limited.  It allows the logistics team to allocate festival site accreditation to incoming staff.  All the information is stored on a the server database removing the need for paper documentation.  

This system is rather bespoke and was used to assist me at my previous employer.

**Requirements**
The logistics manager is the main controller. They are able to add users to manage the allocation and logging process.  As the server will be used for for multiple events the user access to each event is restricted bt default until they are assigned to an event by the logistics manager.

The manager has the task of uploading the details of the staff expected to attend site.  Once the staff are on site they present themselves to the system users. Once the staff details are confirmed a photo is taken of the staff member and their creditials logged before it is passed over to them.

The manager can pull csv reports for later storage.
